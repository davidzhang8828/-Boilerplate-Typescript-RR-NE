## Boilerplate: React/Redux Node/Express

This is a customized boilerplate that allows you to immediately begin working on a React App with Node/Express while using Typescript. Dev mode works with hot module reloading for easy development. A couple of additional add-ons have been tacked onto this boilerplate: SASS, ESLint and Jest for testing.
